This fighter jet web socket game allows anyone to go to the site and instantly start playing. The players use W, A, S, D to move around and SPACE to fire a laser. Jets can be hit with lasers and will respawn after death.

The front-end was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The back-end was made with NodeJS. Both ends use Web Socket to communicate in realtime. I simplified a couple blueprints of space craft, designed by Cloud Imperium Games, into the jet fighters in the game.
